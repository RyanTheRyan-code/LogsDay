# Welcome to LogsDay!

Keeping up with long-term projects can be tough! One day you're full of ideas and energy, and the next day… not so much. It’s easy to get sidetracked or overwhelmed, and before you know it, that project you were so excited about has been gathering dust. LogsDay is here to help! This platform is all about making consistent progress feel achievable—and even fun. By focusing on regular updates, LogsDay transforms project development into a shared journey, where every hurdle, success, and lesson learned becomes part of the story.

LogsDay is a project-based social media platform tailored for anyone managing long-term projects, with a special focus on software developers. The platform’s unique approach centers around regularly scheduled "Logs"—project updates required every eight days to keep users accountable and motivated. Whether you're pushing through tough coding challenges or celebrating small wins, LogsDay encourages transparency and progress.

Posts on LogsDay will be stored securely using Cloud Firestore, allowing users to share their journey and view their progress from anywhere. The platform also incorporates geotagging, helping users discover projects and collaborators in their area, fostering local connections.

Key features include:
Scheduled updates every eight days to maintain a “Log Streak” and track progress.
Image and file uploads, including camera integration for easy documentation.
A calendar page for navigating past LogsDays and planning upcoming updates.
Geotagging for locating nearby projects and users.
Posts linked to Firestore for secure storage and easy retrieval.

Future functionality will further enhance the user experience. Planned features include goal-setting for upcoming LogsDays, tagging posts based on streak length, and adding titled “chapters” to structure project progress. Upon completing a project, users will automatically receive a summary and photo library that captures their entire development journey.

LogsDay is designed to make project development more engaging, collaborative, and transparent, helping users stay on track while connecting with others working on similar challenges.
